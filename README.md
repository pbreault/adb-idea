Usage

The Warrrior's Way

Each command is prefixed by "ADB", so you can quickly filter through adb commands using the "[Find Actions](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/navigating-to-action.html)" shortcut.

The Menu Way
------------
You can find every command in the following menu:
`Tools->Android->ADB Idea` 


Installation
========

Download and install *ADB Idea* directly from Intellij / Android Studio:
